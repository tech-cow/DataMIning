Question 1
---------

* a) From Figure 6.32 we can see there are 22 candidate 3-itemsets in total.
* b) L7, L8, L11, L12 would be visited.
* c) Two candidate 3-itemsets are contained in {1,3,5,6,8}: {5,6,8} and {3,5,6}

Question 2
---------

* a) **True**
  - If 𝑣 ∉ 𝑆, then the supersets of 𝑣 would not belong to 𝑆, so 𝑣 ∉ 𝑆 is monotonic. If 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆, some of supersets of 𝑣 might still belong to S, so 𝑣 ∉ 𝑆 is not antimonotonic. Thus, statement (a) is true.
* b) **False**
  - If 𝑉 ⊂ 𝑆, the supersets of 𝑉 might not be contained in S, so 𝑉 ⊂ 𝑆 is not monotonic. Thus,
statement (b) is false.
* c) **True**
  - When items are price-ascending ordered, 𝑎𝑣𝑔(𝑆) ≥ 𝑣 is monotonic. So 𝑎𝑣𝑔(𝑆) ≥ 𝑣 is convertible into a monotonic rule and statement (c) is true.
